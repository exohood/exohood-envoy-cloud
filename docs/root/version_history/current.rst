1.21.0 (Pending)
================

Incompatible Behavior Changes
-----------------------------
*Changes that are expected to cause an incompatibility if applicable; deployment changes are likely required*

* xds: ``*`` became a reserved name for a wildcard resource that can be subscribed to and unsubscribed from at any time. This is a requirement for implementing the on-demand xDSes (like on-demand CDS) that can subscribe to specific resources next to their wildcard subscription. If such xDS is subscribed to both wildcard resource and to other specific resource, then in stream reconnection scenario, the xDS will not send an empty initial request, but a request containing ``*`` for wildcard subscription and the rest of the resources the xDS is subscribed to. If the xDS is only subscribed to wildcard resource, it will try to send a legacy wildcard request. This behavior implements the recent changes in :ref:`xDS protocol <xds_protocol>` and can be temporarily reverted by setting the ``envoy.restart_features.explicit_wildcard_resource`` runtime guard to false.

Minor Behavior Changes
----------------------
*Changes that may cause incompatibilities for some users, but should not for most*

* bandwidth_limit: added :ref:`response trailers <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.bandwidth_limit.v3.BandwidthLimit.enable_response_trailers>` when request or response delay are enforced.
* bandwidth_limit: added :ref:`bandwidth limit stats <config_http_filters_bandwidth_limit>` *request_enforced* and *response_enforced*.
* config: the log message for "gRPC config stream closed" now uses the most recent error message, and reports seconds instead of milliseconds for how long the most recent status has been received.
* dns: now respecting the returned DNS TTL for resolved hosts, rather than always relying on the hard-coded :ref:`dns_refresh_rate. <envoy_v3_api_field_config.cluster.v3.Cluster.dns_refresh_rate>` This behavior can be temporarily reverted by setting the runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.use_dns_ttl`` to false.
* http: envoy will now proxy 102 and 103 headers from upstream, though as with 100s only the first 1xx response headers will be sent. This behavioral change by can temporarily reverted by setting runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.proxy_102_103`` to false.
* http: usage of the experimental matching API is no longer guarded behind a feature flag, as the corresponding protobuf fields have been marked as WIP.
* json: switching from rapidjson to nlohmann/json. This behavioral change can be temporarily reverted by setting runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.remove_legacy_json`` to false.
* listener: destroy per network filter chain stats when a network filter chain is removed during the listener in place update.
* quic: add back the support for IETF draft 29 which is guarded via ``envoy.reloadable_features.FLAGS_quic_reloadable_flag_quic_disable_version_draft_29``. It is off by default so Envoy only supports RFCv1 without flipping this runtime guard explicitly. Draft 29 is not recommended for use.

Bug Fixes
---------
*Changes expected to improve the state of the world and are unlikely to have negative effects*

* ext_authz: fix the ext_authz network filter to correctly set response flag and code details to ``UAEX`` when a connection is denied.
* listener: fixed the crash when updating listeners that do not bind to port.
* thrift_proxy: fix the thrift_proxy connection manager to correctly report success/error response metrics when performing :ref:`payload passthrough <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.thrift_proxy.v3.ThriftProxy.payload_passthrough>`.

Removed Config or Runtime
-------------------------
